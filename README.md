# Knowledge Graph with Neo4j, Cypher, and GDS

This repository contains materials for the **"Knowledge Graph with Neo4j, Cypher, and GDS"** course. It covers hands-on labs and practical use cases to help you master graph databases, Cypher queries, and the Graph Data Science (GDS) Library using Neo4j.

## Key Topics
- **Neo4j Introduction**: Core architecture, industry applications, and the property graph model.
- **Cypher Query Language**: Basics to advanced features (filtering, aggregation, CRUD, MERGE, WITH).
- **Graph Data Science (GDS) Library**: Centrality, community detection, node similarity, and pathfinding algorithms.
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory allocation tips and best practices for query optimization.

## Labs & Use Cases
- **Neo4j Setup (Windows)**: Installing and exploring Neo4j locally.
- **Crime Investigation**: Solve a case using Cypher.
- **Flights Data Analysis**: Apply GDS algorithms to real-world datasets.
